# Natours Application

This full stack web application is specially designed for persons who love travelling and going on tour vacations.

This app can be found at https://natours-travel.onrender.com/. The documentation of the API for this app can be found at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25439551/2s935oL4Nj The API and the app itself are hosted on the same server.

## Overview
This web application allows it's users to book tour vacations.

A tour refers to a series of locations, specially picked to excite the adventurous spirit of the individual who books it.

A visiting user who has not yet created an account on the app can simply see all the current tours as well as detailed information about each tour.

Once signed up or logged in, they can then book any tour of their choice.

Users can write only one review for any tour they book.

## Purpose
This app is a pet project, built for the express purpose of honing my skills in full stack web development.
